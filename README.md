# Pokedex mini-demo for topcon/mirage

This a very basic and small mini-demo based on the PokeAPI to present an initial list of 15 Pokemon
and then details on each one when selected.

### Original requirements

Original requirements for the exercise can be found inside `./docs/original/` in the form of a PDF
document and a small gif demo.

### Thoughts on solving the exercise

I've recreated with fidelity the features asked for in the requirements.

As per requirements, this has been built using Angular. This means the exercise itself is fairly
simple, as it just means following Angular suggested practices and structure. To run the project, 
just download it, run `npm install` in the root folder of the project and then run 
`ng serve --open` to run the project itself.

This, however, is not really enough. The goal of the exercise was, I know, to go _beyond_ this and 
particularly to focus on good practices, testing, and other additional quality concerns.

For personal reasons, I wasn't able to do this and I will not be going forward with the process.

I have uploaded this here as a simple reminder for myself.
